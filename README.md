# Parsing and save text
**Task:** Create a web application for parsing and storing data into a database

1. On the main page, the user sees the button to select the text file and the field for entering the word for the search. Also, the entire list of previously saved sentences should be displayed below.

2. When you select a text file and enter a search word, the system recognizes and stores in the database all the sentences in which at least once the word for search is found. The sentence should be kept with the letters in the opposite direction, keeping the number of occurrences of the word in this sentence. The sentence is a set of words from a point to a point.
